## Prompt

/sp.specify Module 1 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)Target audience:Beginner–intermediate robotics learners building humanoid robot control systems.Focus:ROS 2 fundamentals for humanoid robotics: Nodes, Topics, Services, URDF, and bridging Python AI agents to ROS controllers with rclpy.Success criteria:- Produces 2–3 clear chapters introducing ROS 2 concepts step-by-step- Includes runnable code examples for Nodes, Topics, Services, and rclpy integration- Explains URDF for humanoid robots with at least one example model- Reader should be able to create a basic ROS 2 workspace and control flow- All explanations beginner-friendly but technically accurateConstraints:- Format: Markdown (Docusaurus-compatible), diagrams allowed- Code must follow ROS 2 (Humble/Iron) conventions- No external robotics theory beyond ROS 2 basics- Keep scope limited to foundational control and message flowNot building:- Advanced ROS 2 navigation, SLAM, or perception- Hardware deployment (simulation only)- Deep dive into Gazebo, Unity, or Isaac (Module 2/3)- Full humanoid build instructions

## Response snapshot

I have created the feature specification for "Module 1 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)".

- **Branch**: `001-ros2-fundamentals`
- **Specification**: `specs/001-ros2-fundamentals/spec.md`
- **Checklist**: `specs/001-ros2-fundamentals/checklists/requirements.md`

The specification is now ready for the planning phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High. This specification is the foundation for developing the first module of the book.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 2 files created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: The `create-new-feature.ps1` script caused issues, but I was able to work around them by manually creating the necessary files and directories. The rest of the process was smooth.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-new-feature.ps1` script failed repeatedly.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate the `create-new-feature.ps1` script to understand why it fails.
