## Prompt

/sp.plan High-level architecture for the Docusaurus-based book- Section/chapter structure for Module 1 and onward- Workflow for AI/Spec-driven writing (Spec-Kit Plus + Claude Code)- Quality validation steps (technical accuracy, clarity, reproducibility)Decisions needing documentation:- Docusaurus structure (sidebar layout, chapter grouping)- Code example format (ROS 2 conventions, rclpy usage)- Diagram style (Mermaid vs images)- Versioning strategy for book updates- Tradeoffs in tutorial depth vs brevityTesting strategy:- Build and preview Docusaurus site for each chapter- Validate code examples by running in ROS 2 workspace- Check consistency and terminology alignment across modules- Confirm compatibility with RAG indexing pipelineTechnical details:- Use iterative write-as-you-build workflow with Spec-Kit Plus- Generate chapters via Claude Code, refine through specs- Organize production in phases: Setup → Draft → Test → Refine

## Response snapshot

I have created the implementation plan for "Module 1 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)".

- **Implementation Plan**: `specs/001-ros2-fundamentals/plan.md`
- **Research & Decisions**: `specs/001-ros2-fundamentals/research.md`
- **Data Model**: `specs/001-ros2-fundamentals/data-model.md`
- **Quickstart**: `specs/001-ros2-fundamentals/quickstart.md`
- **Agent Context**: Updated for Gemini.

The project is now ready for the task generation phase (`/sp.tasks`).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High. This plan provides a clear roadmap for developing the first module of the book.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 4 files created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The planning process was smooth. The `setup-plan.ps1` script worked as expected. The constitution and spec files provided clear guidance for creating the plan.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
