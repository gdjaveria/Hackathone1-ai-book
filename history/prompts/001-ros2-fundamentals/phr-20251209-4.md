## Prompt

/sp.tasks Context for task generation: Produce the complete Module 1 content (2–3 chapters) for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book using Docusaurus and Spec-Kit Plus.Tasks:- Draft beginner-friendly explanations of ROS 2 fundamentals- Create runnable examples for Nodes, Topics, Services, and rclpy- Write a simple URDF example for a humanoid component- Structure chapters according to the Module 1 specification- Generate diagrams (Mermaid or images) to illustrate ROS 2 flows- Ensure consistency with the project Constitution, Specify, and PlanRequirements:- Output must be Markdown (Docusaurus-ready)- Code must follow ROS 2 Humble/Iron conventions- Focus only on Module 1 fundamentals (no simulation or advanced robotics)- Maintain clarity, accuracy, and hands-on learning styleSuccess criteria:- Chapters build cleanly in the Docusaurus site- All code examples run in a ROS 2 workspace- Content matches the defined learning objectives for Module 1- Style and structure align with Spec-Kit Plus standardsNot included:- SLAM, navigation, perception, Gazebo/Unity/Isaac workflows- Hardware deployment or full humanoid assembly

## Response snapshot

I have generated the `tasks.md` file for "Module 1 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)".

- **Tasks File**: `specs/001-ros2-fundamentals/tasks.md`

The tasks are organized by user story and are ready to be worked on.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High. This provides a clear, actionable set of tasks for developing Module 1.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 1 file created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: N/A
- 🧠 Reflection: The task generation process was straightforward. The available design documents provided all the necessary information.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `check-prerequisites.ps1` script did not list all available documents, but I was able to proceed by assuming they existed.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
