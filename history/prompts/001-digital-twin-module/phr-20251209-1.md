## Prompt

/sp.specify Module 2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)Target audience:Beginners–intermediate learners building humanoid robot simulations and virtual environments.Focus:Gazebo physics simulation (gravity, collisions), Unity high-fidelity interaction, and sensor simulation (LiDAR, Depth, IMU).Success criteria:- Produces 2–3 clear chapters covering: 1) Gazebo physics + environment setup 2) Unity rendering + interaction 3) Sensor simulation workflows- Reader understands how digital twins support humanoid robotics- Includes simple, reproducible workflows (conceptual or minimal examples)- Content is beginner-friendly but technically accurateConstraints:- Output: Markdown compatible with Docusaurus- Keep examples lightweight (intro-level simulation only)- No GPU-heavy workflows or advanced robotics algorithms- No full 3D modeling pipelinesNot building:- Complex multi-robot world simulations- Advanced Unity animation systems- Isaac Sim workflows (Module 3 covers that)- Hardware deployment or real-robot tuning

## Response snapshot

The specification for 'Module 2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)' has been successfully created and validated.
Branch Name: 001-digital-twin-module
Spec File Path: specs/001-digital-twin-module/spec.md
Checklist File Path: specs/001-digital-twin-module/checklists/requirements.md
The feature is ready for planning.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Specification for 'Module 2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)' created and validated.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests generated as part of spec creation.
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements.md checklist.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Encountered challenges with PowerShell argument parsing for long feature descriptions, necessitating manual resolution of spec file creation. Future improvements should address robust handling of lengthy and complex string inputs for PowerShell scripts.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: PowerShell argument parsing failure for long string input. `bash.exe` not found in PATH.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate robust PowerShell argument parsing for large multi-line strings, potentially by reading input from a temporary file.
