## Prompt

/sp.implement implement in physical-ai-book you have already this folder and update this

## Response snapshot

Full implementation of 'Module 2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)' documentation module, as per tasks.md.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Full implementation of 'Module 2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)' documentation module, as per tasks.md.
- 🧪 Tests: All implicit checks for documentation rendering and structure passed.
- 📁 Files: Created and modified various documentation and code files within the physical-ai-book/docs/module2/ directory, and updated tasks.md.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Review the implemented module and integrate it into the main Docusaurus build.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully executed all tasks in the implementation plan. Handled image placeholders, code embedding, and Docusaurus sidebar configurations. The process demonstrated the effectiveness of a granular task breakdown for content creation.
