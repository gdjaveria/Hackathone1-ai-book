## Response snapshot

Actionable, dependency-ordered tasks.md generated for 'Module 2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)'.

Path to generated tasks.md: C:\Users\saad\Desktop\hackathone\specs\001-digital-twin-module\tasks.md

Total Task Count: 52 tasks (T001 - T052)

Task Count per User Story:
- Phase 1: Setup: 5 tasks
- Phase 2: Foundational: 4 tasks
- User Story 1 (P1) - Understand Digital Twin Concepts: 5 tasks
- User Story 2 (P1) - Gazebo Physics and Environment Setup: 10 tasks
- User Story 3 (P1) - Unity Rendering and Interaction: 10 tasks
- User Story 4 (P2) - Sensor Simulation Workflows: 10 tasks
- Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns: 8 tasks

Parallel Opportunities Identified:
- Many tasks within User Story phases are marked with [P], indicating they can be worked on in parallel (e.g., drafting different sections of a chapter).
- Development of User Story 2 and User Story 3 can occur concurrently after Phase 1 and 2 are completed, as they have minimal direct dependencies on each other.

Independent Test Criteria for each Story:
- Phase 1: Setup: Docusaurus project contains the basic Module 2 structure.
- Phase 2: Foundational: Introductory content is clear, prerequisite guide is comprehensive, and the module is navigable within Docusaurus.
- User Story 1 - Understand Digital Twin Concepts: Learners can explain digital twins and their relevance to humanoid robotics after completing the introductory content of the module.
- User Story 2 - Gazebo Physics and Environment Setup: Learners can successfully set up a basic Gazebo environment, import or create a simple robot model, and observe expected physics interactions.
- User Story 3 - Unity Rendering and Interaction: Learners can successfully set up a Unity scene, visualize a robot model, and implement basic interactive controls.
- User Story 4 - Sensor Simulation Workflows: Learners can configure and run simulations for LiDAR, Depth, and IMU sensors, and can explain the type of data each sensor provides.
- Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns: Module 2 meets all success criteria outlined in specs/001-digital-twin-module/spec.md.

Suggested MVP Scope: User Story 1 - Understand Digital Twin Concepts, along with Phase 1: Setup and Phase 2: Foundational. This provides a basic, independently testable understanding of digital twins within the module's structure.

Format Validation: All tasks adhere strictly to the checklist format - [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path.
