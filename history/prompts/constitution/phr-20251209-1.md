## Prompt

/sp.constitution Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book + RAG ChatbotCore Principles Beginner–intermediate friendly- Hands-on, implementation-first learning- Technical accuracy (ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac, Nav2, VLA)- Reproducible examples using Spec-Kit Plus- Clear, consistent instructional tone- AI-native workflows (Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus)Standards:- Book built with Docusaurus and deployed on GitHub Pages- All modules include: explanation, code, simulation steps, tasks- Use official terminology (ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac ROS, etc.)- Diagrams: Mermaid or image embeds- Code must run in simulation or follow safe robotics practicesContent Requirements:- Cover: ROS 2, URDF, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2, VLA pipelines, Whisper voice commands- Include final Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Robot- Target audience: beginners to mid-level learnersRAG Chatbot Requirements:- Integrated into Docusaurus site- Tech: FastAPI + Neon Postgres + Qdrant + OpenAI Agents/ChatKit- Answers based only on book content (with selected-text mode)- Retrieval: 500–800 token chunks with metadataConstraints:- Follow Spec-Kit Plus directory and spec formats- All pipelines (indexing, build, deploy) must be automatedSuccess Criteria:- Book builds and deploys without errors- Chatbot provides ≥95% grounded answers- All code examples work in simulation- Content aligned with Physical AI curriculum

## Response snapshot

I have created the project constitution and updated the relevant templates to ensure consistency.

- **Created**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (v1.0.0)
- **Updated**: `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` with new constitution checks.
- **Updated**: `.claude/commands/sp.constitution.md` to remove agent-specific references.
- **Updated**: `.claude/commands/sp.plan.md` to use the correct agent type.
- **Created**: `history/prompts/constitution/phr-20251209-1.md`

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High. The constitution is a foundational document for the project.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 4 files modified, 1 file created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: N/A
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of creating the constitution and ensuring consistency across the project was successful. The PHR creation script was missing, but the fallback instructions were clear.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `create-phr.sh` script was not found.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
