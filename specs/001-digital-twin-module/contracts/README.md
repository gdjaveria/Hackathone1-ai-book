# Contracts

This directory is intended for API contracts (e.g., OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas).
For "Module 2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)", there are no external APIs or services to define contracts for, as this feature involves creating documentation and educational content.
Therefore, this directory remains empty, or contains only this placeholder README.
