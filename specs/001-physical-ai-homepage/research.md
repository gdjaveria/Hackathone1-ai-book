# Research for Home Page — Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This document outlines the research tasks required to resolve the open questions in the implementation plan.

## Research Tasks

### 1. Define the Project Constitution

- **Unknown**: The project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` is a template.
- **Task**: Define the core principles, development standards, quality gates, and governance model for the project. This will involve collaboration with the project stakeholders to establish a clear framework for development.
- **Decision**: The constitution should be based on industry best practices and tailored to the specific needs of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book project. Key areas to define include:
  - **Technology Stack**: Formally document the choice of Docusaurus, React, and TypeScript.
  - **Code Style**: Adopt a standard code style (e.g., Prettier, ESLint) and enforce it.
  - **Testing Strategy**: Define the testing strategy, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
  - **Branching Model**: Specify a branching model (e.g., GitFlow).
  - **Review Process**: Outline the code review and approval process.
- **Rationale**: A well-defined constitution is essential for maintaining code quality, ensuring consistency, and streamlining the development process.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Proceeding without a constitution: This would lead to inconsistency and lower quality.
  - Adopting a generic constitution: This might not be suitable for the specific needs of the project.
