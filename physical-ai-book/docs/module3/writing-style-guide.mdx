# Writing Style Guide: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) Module

This guide establishes conventions for writing content within "The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)" module to ensure consistency, clarity, and effectiveness for our target audience.

## 1. Target Audience & Tone

*   **Audience**: Beginner-to-intermediate robotics learners building humanoid AI systems. Assume familiarity with basic robotics concepts but introduce advanced topics clearly.
*   **Tone**: Informative, encouraging, and technically precise. Avoid overly academic jargon without explanation. Maintain an engaging and accessible voice.

## 2. Clarity & Conciseness

*   **Clear Language**: Use plain English. Avoid ambiguity. Define technical terms upon first use.
*   **Conciseness**: Get straight to the point. Avoid verbose sentences or paragraphs. Every sentence should add value.
*   **Active Voice**: Prefer active voice over passive voice (e.g., "The robot executes the command" instead of "The command is executed by the robot").

## 3. Technical Accuracy

*   **Verification**: All technical claims and explanations must be accurate and verifiable.
*   **Examples**: Use concrete examples to illustrate complex concepts.
*   **Terminology**: Use consistent terminology throughout the module. Refer to official NVIDIA and ROS 2 documentation for correct naming conventions.

## 4. Structure & Formatting

*   **Headings**: Use Markdown headings (H1, H2, H3, H4) logically to structure content.
    *   H1: Module Title (in `introduction.mdx`)
    *   H2: Chapter Titles
    *   H3: Major Sections within chapters
    *   H4: Sub-sections
*   **Paragraphs**: Break up long paragraphs. Each paragraph should ideally focus on one main idea.
*   **Lists**: Use bullet points or numbered lists for readability (e.g., for steps, features, or comparisons).
*   **Code Blocks**: Use Markdown code blocks with appropriate language highlighting (e.g., `python`, `cpp`, `bash`).
*   **Visuals**: Encourage the use of diagrams, flowcharts, and relevant images where they enhance understanding. Provide descriptive captions for all visuals.

## 5. APA Citation Guidelines

*   **Consistency**: Adhere strictly to APA 7th edition citation style for all references.
*   **In-text Citations**: Use author-date format (e.g., (NVIDIA, 2023) or (Smith & Johnson, 2020)).
*   **Reference List**: Include a complete reference list at the end of each chapter or module, alphabetized by author.
*   **Sources**: Prioritize high-quality research papers and official NVIDIA documentation (within the last 5-10 years).

## 6. Docusaurus-Specific Considerations

*   **MDX**: Chapters will be written in MDX (`.mdx` files), allowing for embedded React components if interactive elements are desired (use sparingly and with justification).
*   **Front Matter**: Ensure each `.mdx` file has appropriate Docusaurus front matter (e.g., `title`, `description`, `sidebar_position`).
*   **Internal Links**: Use relative paths for linking between documents within Docusaurus.

## 7. Review Process

*   **Self-Review**: Before submission, review your content against this style guide and the module's objectives.
*   **Peer Review**: Content will undergo peer review for technical accuracy, clarity, and adherence to style guidelines.
