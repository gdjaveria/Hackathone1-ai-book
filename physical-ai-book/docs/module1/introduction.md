# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the first module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book! In this module, we will explore the fundamentals of the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), the nervous system of our humanoid robot.

We will cover the following topics:
- **ROS 2 Nodes**: The basic building blocks of a ROS 2 system.
- **ROS 2 Topics and Services**: The communication channels that allow nodes to exchange information.
- **URDF**: The format used to describe the physical structure of our robot.
- **rclpy**: The Python library for interfacing with ROS 2.

By the end of this module, you will be able to create a basic ROS 2 workspace and understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 that are necessary to build a humanoid robot.
